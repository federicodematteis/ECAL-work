Plots named Transp_prediction_entire_run_<num> are plot of Transparency vs time predicted and measured on the entire "run time"
These plots were obtained using the script EE_2D_Fitting : it fits the fit_func_2 with transparency data in a selected iRing (23-24-25-26)
then uses the parameters fitting for plotting the fit_func_2 as a prediction for Transparency.
So in red we see the predicted value for Transparency and in blue the measured value, and have an idea of their behaviour over time.
  
Plots named predictionfill<num> are the plots for Transparency predicted and real for a single fill;
In one plot we can see different curves for iRing26 fills (three different fills were taken in consideration)
these are the predictions made using different iRings for the same fill.
