At first we do a simple regression with a 2 full connected layer dnn, using one iRing as a train dataset and another one as a validation dataset;
the chosen ativation function is relu for both layers.
We plot the loss function and the predicted transparency vs time, on the same plot we draw real transparency data; 
This plot needs a comparison with the same plot obtained from the previous work (~/plotting folder).
