At first we do a simple regression with a 2-fully-connected-layer dnn, using one iRing as a train dataset and another one as a validation dataset;
the chosen activation function is relu for both layers, the error function (the loss) is chosen as MSE (mean square error).
We plot the loss function and the predicted transparency vs time, on the same plot we draw real transparency data; 
This plot needs a comparison with the same plot obtained from the previous work (~/plotting folder).
